For our use case, hostapd must be compiled with nl80211 support.
The raspbian version that came with the CanaKit seems to have it,
the 2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img does not.

The setup I used to begin with assumes nl80211 to be the appropriate
driver.  AdaFruit assumes rt1871xdrv presumably found within their
custom compiled version of hostapd

When looking for drivers, the following might prove useful:

The load tests were for CPU, RAM and disk I/O, but not for WiFi. Here's
some homework on WiFi limits.
