Its not the nl80211 a device needs to work with, its the cfg80211 api:
http://www.linuxwireless.org/en/developers/Documentation/cfg80211
http://www.linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers
lists wireless devices working in linux: first column-
most realtek chipsets are listed as compatible with cfg80211.

Realtek site:
http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=21&PFid=48&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false
does have a linux driver for my chipset,
the kernel version didn't match but it seemed worth a try anyway.
I got the driver and extracted, inside was a folder named
wpa_supplicant_hostapd, which i thought had to be promising and so after
little more drilling down and extracting compressed folders i had a
folder named
~/RTL8188C_8192C_USB_linux_v3.4.4_4749.20121105/wpa_supplicant_hostapd/wpa_supplicant_hostapd-0.8/hostapd
in this folder there was a makefile so i tried 'make' (this took ages)
and 'make install' (this only seemed to copy 2 files to /usr/local/bin).
I found a bunch of example .conf files in my extracted hostapd folder so
to test i executed '/usr/local/bin/hostapd -dd
~/RTL8188C_8192C_USB_linux_v3.4.4_4749.20121105/wpa_supplicant_hostapd/wpa_supplicant_hostapd-0.8/hostapd/rtl_hostapd_2G.conf'
and lo and behold it worked!!!

It is worth mentioning at this stage that before going though this
journey of discovery i had tried the version of hostapd in my distros
(raspbian) repository so i had an existing broken install of hostapd
that would (fail to) start on boot, to get things rolling along i used
apt to remove the broken install (it left the /etc/init.d/hostapd file
intact) then copied the realtek version of hostapd from /usr/local/bin
to /usr/sbin and my .conf file of choice to /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf as
these were the locations my startup scripts were already pointing to.

My raspberry now provides a fully functional stable access point
everytime it starts :)
