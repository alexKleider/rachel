The accompanying config-howto file describes how to set up your Pi to
run 'headless.' The following describes how you (client) can make use
of this configuration.

Make sure the Raspberry Pi has the following plugged into it:
    1. The appropriate SD Card
    2. The USB WiFi dongle
    3. The ethernet cable (optional) [2]
and then after all the above is done:
    4. Plug in the power cord: microUSB cable.
    (No need for keyboard, mouse or monitor- hence 'headless.')

There is no power switch, simply plugging in a powered microUSB cable turns
it on.  The Pi will take a few minutes to boot up following which you will
have a running server.  To make use of the service(s) provided, client
machines must do the following:
    Connect to the server's WiFi access point (AP): '1stPi2', '2ndPi2', ...
    SSH:  (only for system administration)
        From your command line: ssh pi@10.10.10.10
        You'll be asked to enter the password for user pi (pi::root)
        Your client machine is now simply a terminal (keyboard and monitor
        for your Pi.
    WWW:  (for 'clients')
        Use the client's favourite browser (such as Sugar's Browse activity,
        Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or even Windows) to connect to the server's
        IP address:  10.10.10.10

For system administration:
If your Pi is connected to your local network, an alternative way to 
connect is through the local network (rather than through
the subnet set up through its WiFi) but to do so you'll need to know its
IP address.  This can be 'discovered' by the arp-scan command (Run 
man arp-scan
to learn how to use it.)
It provides a listing of IP addresses: you can usually guess which is
the pi.  Simply try 
ssh pi@<ip-address>
until one of the possibilities works.
